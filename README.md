<h1 align=center>About</h1>
Supersonic is a bot made for Discord. It aims to provide a limitless music playing experience by putting the power in the hands of the user. It works through the Subsonic API, so any media server such as Airsonic or Subsonic support it.

<br>

<h1 align=center>Motivation</h1>
After larger music bots like Groovy and Rhythm were taken down by Youtube in an attempt to limit the usage of their API, it was clear that Discord music bots had to move away from media giants in order to not risk being taken down. Supersonic is the answer to Youtube's decision - as it is up to you to provide the server that streams the media.

<br>

<h1 align=center>Features</h1>
* Powerful audio managment using Slash Commands & Buttons
* Choose from a collection of public music servers to use in your Discord server
* If you don't like the content they have, you can always make and add your own!
